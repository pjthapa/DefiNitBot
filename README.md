# DefiNitBot
<h3>A Tipbot for reddit using the cryptocurrency Algorand to tip layer-2 token Definite.<br /></h3>
Uses Algorand's PyTeal to send tips and  implements a few simple data structures to keep track of users of the bot.</h3>

<h2> How to use the bot:</h2><br/>
<h5>1) Opt in to use the bot in reddit</h5>
<li>Make sure that you have added Defi-Nite ASA (ID: 400593267 ) to your Algorand Wallet</li>
<li>Click the link below</li>
<li>Type "opt in" in the subject and </li>
<li>Your Algorand wallet address in the message.</li>
<li>Send the message</li>
<br />
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=DefiniteASABot" >OPT IN HERE </a>
  <br />
  Now your wallet address is opted in to the bot. Anytime someone replies to your comment with "!Definitely!" in the subreddit r/finite_asa, you will recieve a tip from them in the form of the Algorand Standart Asset Definite.
  
  <h5>2) How to tip someone else </h5><br />
  Reply !Definitely! to any posts or comments in r/Finite_ASA and the bot will tip the user (provided that the user has registered their account with the bot). The command is not case sensitive so no need to worry about that.
  
  <h2> HAPPY TIPPING! </h2>
~~~The tip bot is currently discontinued. I will look to be back soon~~~
